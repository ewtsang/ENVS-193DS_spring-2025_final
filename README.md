# ENVS-193DS_spring-2025_final
ENV S 193 - Statistics for Environmental Science, Final, Spring 2025

## General information

This repository is for my Final for ENV S 193 DS, Spring 2025. This final assignment will...
(1) Demonstrate my research writing skills -- ability to identify gaps in statistical communication, and write about statistics without a complete analysis of the information needed. (2) Additionally, I will be performing data visualization using data from the Santa Barbara Coastal LTER on sea surface temperature in the Santa Barbara Channel. (3) Next, I will be working with the next box occupancy dataset from Stojanovic, D. Owens, G., Young, C.M., Alves, F., and Heinsohn, R. 2021. “Do nest boxes breed the target species or its competitors? A case study of a critically endangered bird.” Restoration Ecology. DOI: 10.1111/rec.13319 . (4) Finally, there will be a comparison of affective visualizations and the final product.

### Packages

Will need:
```
library(tidyverse) # general use
library(here) # file organization
library(janitor) # cleaning data frames
library(gt) # creating tables
library(readxl) # reading excel files
library(scales) # modifying axis labels
library(ggplot) # creating models
```

## Data and file information
File structure:

```
.
├── ENVS-193DS_workshop-08.Rproj
├── README.md
├── code                                     # code folder
│   
└── data                                     # data folder
    └── 
```

All code is in the `code` folder. The code runs models, generates model predictions, and visualizes data.
